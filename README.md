# Reusable Report Generator As-a-Service

## Reasoning

Ultimate goal of this project is to facilitate the report generation activities faced by the users, by introducing pattern-based rules approach.
It is believed that such an approach would be much more convenient for the IT-acknowledged person to deliver a highly flexible report pattern for the Business Person.

### Rules
Rules maybe be seen as a high-level language of abstractions that tell report generator engine parser which operations to perform.
The behaviour of the parser is controlled by the system configuration.
